## Getting Started
1. Browse the relevant folder based on your needs
2. Each folder contains a README.md with specific details about its contents
3. MATLAB files can be directly opened and executed in MATLAB environment
4. Reference the documentation in each folder for file organization guidelines

## File Organization Guidelines
- **Assignments**: Organized by assignment number or topic
- **Exams**: Organized by exam type (midsem, final) and semester
- **MATLAB Scripts**: Organized by topic or assignment
- **Notes**: Organized by lecture number, topic, or date
- **Reference Books**: Organized by author, subject, or relevance
- **Reports**: Organized by project type and submission date

## Contributing
When adding new files:
1. Place them in the appropriate folder
2. Follow the naming conventions described in each folder's README
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Maintain clear and descriptive commit messages

This repository structure follows academic best practices for course material organization.
